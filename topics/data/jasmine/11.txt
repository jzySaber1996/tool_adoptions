["jasmine dom testing . hi all.i am facing issues in writing test cases for dom elements using jasmine.my function is:function sample (event){$('#select').dropkick('reload'); }please provide me steps to test the above function using jasmine-jquery.jsthanks in prior.", "hey kiruthikakumar. do you know what you'd specifically like to test about this function? what do you expect to happen after calling `dropkick('reload')`?", 'hi mrjoelkemp  i need to check whether dropkick reload is called or not', "+1good library! i'd like to see it in npm", 'the name `jasmine-jquery` already taken by dkastnerdkastner. you keep fork of this repo in npm. please update it or provide rights to this repository owner', 'it makes no difference what is the name of the library. call it `velesin-jasmine-jquery`.', 'i will remove my package', 'unpublished!', 'hi. i got same issue and reason was that js files was loaded in wrong order. broblem was that jasmine-jquery was loaded before jquery and caused that $ was missing (undefined).', 'tohavebeentriggeredonandwith takes ages and fails.. hi jasmine-jquery team. i\'m trying to evaluate the values of a triggered event. the `expect(event_spy).tohavebeentriggered()` function passes and if i  use the `expect("chart_extremes_changed").tohavebeentriggeredon(document)` instead of the `.tohavebeentriggeredonandwith` function. the test also passes.but with the `.tohavebeentriggeredonandwith` function it somehow tries to print out the whole document (which takes long time) and then it fails. i also tried to trigger events on some div\'s. but with the result. that the event isn\'t triggered and evaluated at all. am i using it the wrong way?```    it \'should set the extremes both min and max values from date class\'.
