['jstestdriver integration. not sure what i am doing wrong but doesnt seem to work with jstestdriverfor loading fixtures in jstestdriver a jasmine config is not necessary can you explain how we could load fixtures with jstestdriver?thanks much appreciated', "i have no idea i don't use jstestdriver. post a whole piece of code to look at and make sure you're not doing something wrong at least.", "thanks justlaputa for posting that. looks pretty thorough. i'll link to this issue from the readme in-case other jstd users come along.", 'thanks. glad to be helpful!', "thank you for posting that. sorry i had not posted back in a few days i got tied up with work. i'll try this out tonight.", "add support for postgresql. the basic functionality seems to be working.  the 'postgres' dialect has been added to spec-jasmine/dao.spec.js and spec-jasmine/dao-factory.spec.js and all the tests are passing.", 'hi :) just merged your pull request :) now i only have to get travis-ci work :d', 'thanks for your awesome work', 'feel free to add yourself to the contributors in package.json', 'may i ask what you use sequelize for?', "i don't actually use sequelize for anything yet.  i am planning to refactor a prototype i built using python and mongodb using node and postgresql/sequelize - turns out the data was more relational than i initially anticipated.  now i just need transactions... :)thanks for the quick action on the pull request!", "i faced an issue in angular application :eg. driver.findelement(by.classname('login'));  - its not workingbut i made a slight modification to identify it adding 'browser'browser.driver.findelement(by.classname('login')); - this worked fine when i included (browser) but when comes to angular propertieselement(by.model('pin')).sendkeys(3);this is not working .. how to proceed", "hi juliemr . sorry for the late reply. it seems that adding `framework: 'jasmine2'` to the config file solved it! thanks", 'ricogallo lucky you if you can switch to `jasmine2` so easily! :smile:juliemr should i open a dedicated new issue for our case?', 'fix(stacktrace): remove jasmine2 specific stacktraces', "i can't reproduce this. here's a config and test that i used to verify that `browser.get` gets called:``` jsexports.config = {  directconnect: true.  capabilities: {    'browsername': 'chrome'  }.  framework: 'jasmine2'.  specs: ['example_spec.js'].  onprepare: function() {    browser.driver.manage().window().maximize();    browser.get('  }};`````` jsdescribe('site'. function() {  it('should do stuff'. function() {    expect(browser.gettitle()).toequal('super calculator');    expect(true).tobe(true);  });});```can you modify this to get the same failure you're seeing?", 'merged as e3d4ad164a04451fce3a57f06121355343c97f48', "we have many tests that use jasmine2 and resultjsonoutputfile. so this is nota  general issue. i'm not familiar with the `jasmine-expect` module. but that may be causing your issues.if you can create a reproducible example that shows your problem. please feel free to open up a new issue. otherwise. i'm closing as not reproducible.", '"hi julie ralph.the issue was with assertions for only passed test cases. failed cases are perfectly fine. before adding jasmine2 as framework in config. i used to get assertions results for passed ones too. eg: below```[    {        ""description"": ""test1"".
