["hey jmeas. any update on that pr?i'm having similar issues where the the original (in) source map `sourcescontent` aren't copied to the source map generated by uglify (which means i'm losing data in the process). for now i have to completely stop using uglify if i'm using any source map with `sourcescontent` within them.", "is this all the code you're uglifying? i don't see anything wrong with it. or with the uglified result:``` jstry{var part=file.slice(0.2);reader.readasarraybuffer(part)}catch(e){onunreadable()}```", "regarding my earlier comment about #290. didn't realise that the uglify-js2 package was deprecated. i suggest you just close #39. #89. and #290 instead. eventually it would be great to just unpublish that package.", '.uglifyrc +1']
