["you should be able to change your tests to `assert.strictequal(nan. nan)` and they will function as expected. basically. to maintain feature parity with node.js' include assertions. `assert.equal` must do only `==` testing with no special sauce. if you do `assert.strictequal()` that is the equivalent of using `expect(nan).to.equal(nan)`. which is where your `_.samevalue` comes into play.", 'new methods. new tests. - new methods: forward/back + elements related method (most from gamechanger)- added sauce test suite + initialization unit tests - an object may be passed to wd.remote. allowing base path modification. and more flexible config. (but passing parameters still works).']
