['penfold wzup thank you both of you. the solution is indeed starting a standalone selenium server and configuring the protractor-conf.js file. i managed to run protractor too this way. thanks again.', "sounds like it's an external selenium bug then. labeling...", "my main reason: protractor is promoted as 'angular' e2e. i came in from generic webtesting (selenium/webdriver.io) and now have to relearn a new syntax.i understand there is a style choice in  language. i happen to prefer the more terse style from webdriver.io . it's less coding centric. more q/a orientedmy 2c", 'ah ok. i see the issue. the problem is that `selenium-webdriver/testing` only wraps the global functions (`global.it`) once. at the point when it is required. then it reuses them. but mocha has actually changed the underlying `global.it` by the second suite.', 'feat: accept promises in the configuration. change hosteddriverprovider to optionally accept a promise for the seleniumaddress', ':thumbsup:', ':+1: everything else is promised. why not this. it would allow users to have custom logic to grab selenium instances.', 'juliemr just signed it.', 'gettext() not working for title element. i\'m getting the empty string back from a gettext() call.  i\'ve got this in my index.html:```<title ng-bind="pagetitle"></title>```this is in my controller:```$scope.pagetitle = "banana";```this is in my protractor test:```var pagetitle = element(by.binding(\'pagetitle\'));expect(pagetitle.gettext()).tobe(\'banana\');```the page title is displayed correctly in the browser. even when selenium pops up a window for the test. but my test always fails saying "expected \'\' to be \'banana\'".  nobody wants their empty strings to be bananas. just their bananas.  i\'m aware that gettext() doesn\'t work with input elements. but this is a title element.  thanks!', "i've also tried this approach. to see if it was a laziness issue:```element(by.binding('pagetitle')).gettext().then(function (title) {  expect(title).tobe('banana');});```", "title isn't a visible element to the user. so webdriver doesn't return it as having text. you probably want`browser.gettitle()`", "oh i see. so webdriver's not delivering the content that way?
