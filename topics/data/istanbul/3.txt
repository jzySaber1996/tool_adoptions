['add browserify-istanbul dev dependency.. partial fix for #113', 'thanks for the feedback :) hard to get one even in my company. where i introduced it few months ago.so the sorting is definitely a concern. although i hardly remember to ever use it. i left it broken. because i felt like there will be a better time to address this when i will implement it the _clean_ way.i haven\'t try this on mobile (iphone or android tablet) until you pointed out some issues on smaller screen. i saw the modal is in fact unpredictable. so i will try to find a better component or simply fallback to page reload.the summary with chart is based on some first idea that came to my head when i tried to make it "speak" to the reader something meaningful. _consumable_ at first glance. i agree it will be better to change the message and i already suppressed the animation for the [demo](). if you have any better idea for top section. please don\'t hesitate to share :)', 'i am having the same issue.  i found some fix that uses comments to ignore lines of code like /* istanbul ignore next */ but these do not work at all.']
