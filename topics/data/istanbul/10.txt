["being able to set the mode from a cli switch is something i've wanted for a while. but mocha's grep does not play nicely with `.only` - so i haven't seen a way to easily use it to run one test in a specified mode.also getting through both `npm` and `istanbul` to pass the argv correctly means it looks something like `npm test -- -- --grep fsevents`.i started playing with something yesterday that might work out to be a good enough solution on this point. we'll see.", '(#5426) - remove dead code. improve coverage. trying to take some time to clean up technical debt. places where i added `istanbul ignore`s are where i considered it too difficult or unimportant to test. places where i removed the `ignore`s are where i added tests. at least in node.', 'nice changes. but looks like the `websql` test is a valid failure', "yup. it was a test error due to `sqlite3` throwing an error when trying to open a db on an invalid path. the test didn't make much sense for `node-websql` (and doesn't seem fixable without a pr to `sqlite3`). so i just skipped it for `node-websql`. passing now.", 'awesome. thanks', 'thanks stale. this is no longer relevant']
