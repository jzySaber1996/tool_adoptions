['failing due only to code coverage dropping below 100%. you may need to throw some `/* istanbul ignore */`s in there.', "i was going to rebase with the `istanbul ignore` fixes. but it looks like this line is totally unused:``` jsif (typeof this._put === 'function' && !!opts.new_edits) {    this._put(doc. opts. cb);}```correct me if i'm wrong willholley but doesn't this mean that your fix isn't actually run? seems it should at least run for the http adapter.", 'we shouldnt need to mock anything. the http adapter is used in the node test suite and we have tests that perform checkpointing so it should be run. can take a look but yeh we cant istanbul ignore that line. need to figure why its not being hit', "if coverage is failing. then i suppose we need more `/* istanbul ignore */`s. assuming it's not possible to actually have the tests run through the ignored code.", '`--` is meant to split the args so that everything after `--` is passed as arguments to ytestrunner and not to istanbul.', "ah ok. in that case if i get istanbul working for myself then hopefully that might make things better.i also just realised that utils.js isn't included in the tests. seems to be missing from the --include options."]
