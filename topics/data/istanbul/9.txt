['switch to nyc code coverage tool. the istanbul command line tool has been superseded by their [newer nyc tool](', "is it possible to control the level of the instrumentation?. hi.i'm using 'istanbul-lib-instrument' to create an instrumentor for static instrumentation and it causes the original js to become huge - from 14mb to ~160mb.since i don't care about statement coverage. i wonder if there's a way to configure the instrumentor to generate code for methods and branches but not to generate statements related code?i think that it may reduce the size drastically.i'll appreciate your help.cheers.nadav", "btw - if not. i don't mind contributing this feature. but i'll need some high level guidance.", 'ping']
