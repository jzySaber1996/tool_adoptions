['any idea why this might break istanbul? for some reason it just hangs when writing coverage', "i r=me'd a one like istanbul comment so we should be back at 100%", "i've never used nodeunit. but in theory it shouldn't be too different from anything else.  at some point before you load up any of your code. you want to `require 'coffee-coverage/register-istanbul'`.  this will cause .coffee files to be instrumented by coffee-coverage as they are loaded. and will create `coverage/coverage-coffee.json` when your process terminates.  then just run your tests.if that doesn't get you going. if you have a sample project using nodeunit i can play with. i can try to help you out a bit.", "that was the key to getting it running. i was already running nodeunit programmatically and i was already registering coffee-script. so i just replaced. `require 'coffee-script/register'` with `require 'coffee-coverage/register-istanbul'` and everything worked fine from there. thanks.", "debugging is already supported with the `--debug` and `--inspect`. i don't feel that we have the man power to add support for more specific debugging tools that don't run on the remote debugging concept and possibly require platform specific hacks and caveats.if you want gdb to work with mocha i'd definitely recommend the approach scott already outlined with wrapping around the mocha binary. like istanbul for example already does", "yeah. i saw this one yesterday. i tested the rules against our code base and some weren't applying cleanly on top of the actual code base. so i edited pieces of it in the grunt branch. i'll bring them over the gulp ones and try the lastest one on mocha.there's no istanbul (coverage at all?) plugin for gulp as of yet. but i really like how they're written. i'll probably take a stab at it in the next few days.", "that's pretty standard... you don't check in node_modules. and on doing an npm install. it will install the modules for you. just try `npm install gulp-coffee-istanbul` and that should install all the files you need. hope this helps!"]
