["sure no prob... did we ever reach a consensus on whether or not to include `imagemin` in the build task? i hear what rhutchison is saying about it being opinionated... i could go either way... some projects won't really need imagemin...aside from the coveralls issues. imagemin is ready to go and supports jpg. png. gif and svg. will send a fix later today", 'yeah sorry i should have mentioned.... i had to merge master in order to get the coveralls tests to pass... it was failing due to missing test coverage.']
