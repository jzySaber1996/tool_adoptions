['publish to coveralls.io from travis.. what it says on the tin! i thought this might be handy for reviewing coverage. not sure if this "just works" or if someone in the bower org needs to log in to coveralls.', 'based on the travis build failing. someone would need to sign in to .', "sure thing. if you know what is on line 145 in index.js when the index.js in reality have 30 lines. and what is covered is totaly wrong if you look at the coveralls.io webpage.sure thing. then this wouldn't need a fix.as trueadm knows. there was and is issues with wrong lines reported on the coveralls.io as well.", 'integrate coveralls.io. while our test suite (part of `npm test`) will enforce the 100% coverage threshold. the lack of enough coverage will be only visible from the command-line output. i.e. if one looks at travis ci report in details.with coveralls integration. when a pull request contains one or more commits that regress the coverage. the coverage information will be displayed at the pull request page. thereby giving a direct indication of the issue.', 'add and setup coveralls.io', "visual code coverage tool. it would be nice to view the code coverage visually instead of just the spec report at the end of unit tests. this would help find subtler issues like untested branches. we should set up something like coveralls.io. it's free for open source and plugs in nicely with travis. we'll have to create an sparkpost account first. other solutions would be fine too.", 'just found the test/reports directory :) so. um. yeah. gonna close this.']
