["remove snyk from regular test run. running snyk in ci is regular pain point since pr builds can't include the secure token. since this module will only ever be used in the context of a larger project - which can and absolutely should run snyk on its dependency tree - then i don't think it is necessary to also protect here.", "sorry for the naive question but why is it that pr builds can be run on other builds with snyk and not here?but you are right that it doesn't need to be here", "> [why can] pr builds can be run on other builds with snykthey generally can't. travis doesn't expose secret env vars to prs - otherwise you could open a malicious pr on any repo that posted the environment variables to your server. and steal all the secrets.it might (i can't recall exactly) that prs from branches within the same repo are allowed access to env vars. but since this doesn't scale at all. it shouldn't be relied on.", 'i had a look around a few other hof repos. and the only ones i found using snyk in ci were doing a dance to only run it on master builds and not prs.', "i don't really mind leaving the script there. people can run it if they want to."]
