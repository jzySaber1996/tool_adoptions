['lirantal any update on this?', "we're blocked on the snyk platform finding a solution to work around travis-ci implementation which doesn't allow the token to be used for forked repos which is what happening when prs are being run.we're already integrating with snyk through github so we're ok.", 'i\'m not sure why `snyk` would add itself to our package dependencies. along with the other changes to *package.json*. my assumption was that it was merely an external service that monitored the repo.i suppose that when we opted in to use snyk. we agreed to some sort of level of trust that it "knows best"? :)', "guys i'm going to remove snyk from being run through travis ci. mainly because we already have security integration through github as part of our checks so once we have a good baseline we don't need the cli running.i'll re-visit this to fix it properly and ping you with the update.", "i agree that we shouldn't have it integrated as part of the skeleton so that users who fork and may choose not to work with snyk don't have this tie-in. we're already covered from security aspects in terms of monitoring our project both through the snyk.io platform and their github integration as you can see in the pr for tests that pass.i'll close this and open a pr to give outdated packages.", "don't need this anymore. closing."]
