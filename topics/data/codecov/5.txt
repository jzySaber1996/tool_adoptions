['danez i squashed my pr. adding tests. apparently codecov does not update its review.the tests are in the `test/expressions` directory. i added an `esprima` test set based on the expressions test i could find in `fixtures/esprima`  (keeping the licence file i found in this dir). and an `is-babylon-expression` dir with the tests that were in this module.you will see i added a new `denylinecomment` option (defaults to false) to babylon.this was a trade-off that i measured via benchmarks to keep a feature that was in `is-babylon-expression`. raising an exception for expressions that finish with a linecomment.timothygu. note that i reversed the default behavior of `is-babylon-expression` to avoid having a different default for `parse` and `parseexpression` so `linecomment: true` is not necessary anymore. and all other cases need a `denylinecomment: true`tell me what you think and if we agree on this. i will then add documentation on the readme regarding the new option and `parseexpression` api.thanks', "could you please rebase the commit on current master? the commit it is currently based on seems to be broken. that's why codecov is not updating.", 'there is a prob with node 7 #338 nathanmarks can you help out with both issues?', 'mmmmm i just investigated through snyk.io and got a different report : to me a false positive from npm adding these 2 deps (codecov and coveralls) to published packages ?i have added snyk to our ci. thanks tamethecomplex', 'merging despite the churlishness of codecov. this is really cool!', 'fine codecov. fine.', "yikes! i didn't want to freak you out. i was joking about codecov being odd.", 'turns out i dont understand codecov yet. why does it say coverage drops when all i did was add a test case?']
